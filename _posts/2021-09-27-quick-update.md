A lot of new photos from 9/26, but this will just be a placeholder entry until I have time to upload them. We stayed out late to celebrate my birthday after meeting up with some old friends again for Mass and a walk around Rome. Highlights:

* Chiesa della Santissimi Trinita dei Pellegrini, the FSSP church in rome. Small (we were quite crowded for the 11:00 mass!) but a very beautiful church.
* Doing the [Heart of Rome](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours/italy) audio tour from Rick Steves, we hit a number of highlights from the Campo dei Fiori to the Pantheon to the Spanish Steps.
* We then took the Metro one stop north and walked back from the Piazza del Populo to the vicinity of the Pantheon
* Finished up the day with some pretty great food at Ristorante Trattoria Antonio al Pantheon

Slept in a bit today (9/27) and now getting ready to rush off for the Colosseum and Roman Forum!
