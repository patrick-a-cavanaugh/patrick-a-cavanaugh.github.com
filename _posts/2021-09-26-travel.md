We set off from Dulles Airport on Friday evening after a pretty uneventful subway and bus ride (Finally rode the new Metro Silver Line to the current end for the first time, so that was cool I guess?)

Our flight was with an airline that was new to me - TAP Air Portugal. We had to exchange our digital boarding pass for a printed card at the gate, where they also checked us for COVID-19 test documentation. Unfortunately one person in line behind us hadn’t heard of the new requirements and only brought a vaccine card and we had to hear them tell her she couldn’t fly.

After a 6 hour hop over the Atlantic to Lisbon (I got maybe 3 hours of sleep), we had a two hour layover in the Lisbon airport and then on to Rome!

We took a Regionale train from the airport to Roma Termini, the central train station, where we met some friends. Then onward to our lodgings for the night at [Villa Letizia](https://villaletizia.net/en/). We took the subway and then attempted to get a bus there, as it’s on the outskirts of town. The wait for the bus was pretty long though and we ended up just walking.

Each of our rooms is pretty Spartan but is equipped with a fan, beds, and a bathroom. No TV, but there is a nice view

After getting settled in we walked back along our path and went to one of the restaurants we had walked by. 

The food was great and nice views!

Then off to bed to prepare for a lot of sightseeing starting tomorrow!
